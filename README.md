## Usage

The individual will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. They can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

The financial planner will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
